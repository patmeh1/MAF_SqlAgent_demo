# SQL Agent Demo - Customer Presentation Guide

## 🎯 Demo Objective

Demonstrate how Azure OpenAI GPT-4o can enable natural language querying of SQL databases through an intelligent agent, showcasing Microsoft's AI capabilities for enterprise data access.

## 👥 Target Audience

- Business users who need database access without SQL knowledge
- Data analysts looking for faster query generation
- Decision makers evaluating AI-powered data solutions
- Developers interested in AI agent frameworks

## 📊 Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- Traditional database queries require SQL expertise
- Business users often wait for IT/analysts to run reports
- AI agents can democratize data access
- This demo shows GPT-4o translating natural language to SQL

**Talking Points:**
> "Today I'll show you how we can use Azure OpenAI to make database querying accessible to everyone in your organization, regardless of their technical background. We've built an intelligent agent that understands natural language and automatically generates the right SQL queries."

### 2. Architecture Overview (3 minutes)

**Show the diagram from README:**

```
User Question (Natural Language)
        ↓
   SQL Agent (GPT-4o)
        ↓
   SQL Query Generation
        ↓
   Azure SQL Database
        ↓
   Results + Natural Language Response
        ↓
   Web Chat Interface
```

**Key Components:**
- **Azure SQL Database**: Northwind sample (customers, orders, products)
- **Azure AI Foundry**: GPT-4o deployment
- **SQL Agent**: Intelligence layer with schema awareness
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly chat UI

**Talking Points:**
> "The architecture is straightforward but powerful. When a user asks a question, our agent uses GPT-4o which has been provided with the complete database schema. It generates optimized SQL, executes it safely, and returns both the data and a natural language explanation."

### 3. Live Demo - Basic Queries (5 minutes)

**Demo Script:**

**Query 1: Simple Selection**
```
User: "Show me all products"
```

- Highlight the formatted results table
- Note the natural language response

**Query 2: Filtering**
```
User: "What are the top 5 most expensive products?"
```
- Show how it uses TOP and ORDER BY
- Emphasize that user didn't need to know SQL syntax

**Query 3: Aggregation**
```
User: "How many customers do we have in each country?"
```
- Demonstrate GROUP BY generation
- Show the aggregated results

### 4. Advanced Capabilities (5 minutes)

**Demo Script:**

**Query 4: Complex Join**
```
User: "Show me orders from customers in Germany"
```
- Highlight the automatic JOIN between tables
- Explain how the agent understands relationships

**Query 5: Business Intelligence**
```
User: "What is the total revenue by category?"
```
- Show calculation capabilities
- Demonstrate business logic in natural language

**Query 6: Employee Analysis**
```
User: "Which employees have the most orders?"
```
- Multiple table joins
- Aggregation and sorting

### 5. Key Features Highlight (3 minutes)

## 🎬 Demo Best Practices

### Preparation

1. **Before the Demo:**
   - Verify Azure resources are running
   - Test all sample queries
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Have backup screenshots ready
   - Review customer's industry for relevant analogies

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
   - Increase browser zoom for visibility (125%)
   - Clear previous conversation history
   - Have the architecture diagram ready

3. **Contingency Plan:**
   - Have screenshots of successful queries
   - Know how to explain errors positively
   - Have alternative queries ready
   - Can fall back to explaining the code

### During the Demo

**Do's:**
- Start with simple queries
- Explain what's happening at each step
- Pause for questions
- Show both SQL and results
- Relate examples to customer's use case
- Be enthusiastic about the results
- Acknowledge when queries are complex

**Don'ts:**
- Rush through queries
- Skip explaining the SQL generated
- Ignore errors (use them as learning moments)
- Make unverifiable claims
- Assume technical knowledge
- Forget to highlight Azure services

### Handling Questions

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "Can it handle all SQL queries?"**
> A: "The agent is designed for SELECT queries to ensure data safety. For modifications, you'd integrate it with proper authentication and authorization workflows."

**Q: "What if it generates incorrect SQL?"**
> A: "GPT-4o is highly accurate when provided with schema information, but we always recommend reviewing generated queries. The system can also learn from corrections."

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
> A: "Costs include Azure SQL Database, Azure OpenAI API calls, and minimal compute. Actual cost depends on usage, but typically ranges from $X-Y per month for Z users. Let's schedule a follow-up to discuss your specific scenario."

**Q: "Can it work with our existing databases?"**
> A: "Absolutely! The agent automatically reads any SQL Server schema. We'd just need to connect it to your database and configure appropriate access controls."

**Q: "How secure is this?"**
> A: "It uses Azure's enterprise-grade security including encrypted connections, firewall rules, and can integrate with Azure AD for authentication. We recommend read-only credentials for production use."

**Q: "Can we customize the interface?"**
> A: "Yes, completely. The web interface is fully customizable, and we can integrate this with your existing applications via API."
